These included the department store La Rinascente, Zanotta, Poltranova and Knoll, expanding in the 1970's to include Martinelli Luce and Artemide, for whom she designed lights. Aulenti also taught at Venice School of Architecture from 1960–1962 and at the Milan School of Architecture from 1964-1967.\r\n\r\n### Her style\r\nAulenti was one of the few women designing in the postwar period in Italy while creating many elegant pieces that spanned across a wide variety of styles and influences, with a focus on modern, radical design. She did however always want the focus of the room to be the occupants, she believed the people make the room a room and to not overpower.\r\nShe had a modest style, Vogue has her saying \"advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values.\"\r\n\r\n# The table lamp: *Quadrifoglio*\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n* Infos: Gae Aulenti table lamp \"Quadrifoglio\" for Guzzini, Italy, 1970.\r\n* Composition: chrome structure with caramel colored plastic shade.\r\n* Eras: 1900s / 20th century\r\n* Styles: Italian, '70s style\r\n* Materials: chromed steel, plastic.\r\n* Measurements: 48 x 48 x 52 cm (DxWxH)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nQuadrifoglio is a variation of the more famous \"Pipistrello\" table lamp of Gae Aulenti.
