These are a table lamp, a rocking chair and a coffee table.\r\n\r\n### Table of contents\r\n* The Architect\r\n* The table lamp: Quadrifoglio\r\n* The rocking chair: Sgarsulv\r\n* The coffe table: Jumbo\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Architect\r\n\r\n## Gaetana Aulenti (1927 – 2012)\r\n![Gae Aulenti image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/gh-pages/02_gae-aulenti_popup.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Her life\r\nBetter known as Gae Aulenti, she was an architect, designer, theorist and one of the best-known Italian designers in the second half of the 20th century. Her reputation being enhanced by a major award at the 1964 Milan Triennale, her participation in the seminal Italy: The New Domestic Landscape at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1972 and her award-winning layout of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris (1980-86).\r\nIn addition to her striking \"Arrivo al Mare\" installation in the Italian Pavilion at the 1964 Milan Triennale, utilizing Picasso-inspired silhouettes and mirrors, during the 1960s she also designed furniture for a number of clients. These included the department store La Rinascente, Zanotta, Poltranova and Knoll, expanding in the 1970's to include Martinelli Luce and Artemide, for whom she designed lights. Aulenti also taught at Venice School of Architecture from 1960–1962 and at the Milan School of Architecture from 1964-1967.\r\n\r\n### Her style\r\nAulenti was one of the few women designing in the postwar period in Italy while creating many elegant pieces that spanned across a wide variety of styles and influences, with a focus on modern, radical design. She did however always want the focus of the room to be the occupants, she believed the people make the room a room and to not overpower.\r\nShe had a modest style, Vogue has her saying \"advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values.\"\r\n\r\n# The table lamp: *Quadrifoglio*\r\n![quadrifoglio lamp image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/final-project/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio%20reference%20image.jpeg)\r\n## Specifications\r\n* Infos: Gae Aulenti table lamp \"Quadrifoglio\" for Guzzini, Italy, 1970.\r\n* Composition: chrome structure with caramel colored plastic shade.\r\n* Eras: 1900s / 20th century\r\n* Styles: Italian, '70s style\r\n* Materials: chromed steel, plastic.\r\n* Measurements: 48 x 48 x 52 cm (DxWxH)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nQuadrifoglio is a variation of the more famous \"Pipistrello\" table lamp of Gae Aulenti. It is composed by four slices of plastic supported by four steel tubes standing on a circular steel base.\r\n\r\n## Decomposition\r\nThe 3D reconstruction of Quadrifoglio lamp is composed by:\r\n* shade\r\n* circular base\r\n* supporting tubes\r\n* light bulb\r\n* bolts\r\n\r\n### The rotational symmetry\r\nEach one of these elements was conceived to be a quarter of the complete object, to leverage the rotational symmetry of the lamp along the Z-axis. To obtain a complete lamp I should onlu change the \"copies\" parameter of the REPLICA function.\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(1).png)\r\n```\r\n//with copies = 4 this code construct the lamp\r\nrotationalGroup = STRUCT(REPLICA(copies)([ disk, topDisk, pillarAngles, pillarArm, foot, COMP([lampR])]));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The shade\r\nThe shade was the most interesting part to model. I imagined a quarter of the shade to be a deformed sphere, so I used the SPHERE function as a base and modified to transform the output on the three axis. With a proper domain I could strip down the unnecessary parts and obtain the desired slice of the shade.\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(0).png)\r\n```\r\n//this function is based on a SPHERE function but with different coefficients\r\nlampQuarterFunc = function (arg){\r\n\tvar a = arg[0];\r\n\tvar b = arg[1] + PI/2.0;\r\n\tvar u = SIN(a) * (COS(b) +1) * 0.9;\r\n\tvar v = (SIN(a)+0.25) * SIN(b);\r\n\tvar w = COS(a);\r\n\treturn [u,v,w];\r\n};\r\n```\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(2).png)\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(3).png)\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(4).png)\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(5).png)\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20(6).png)\r\n\r\nThe same model was made Python-compatible with few code adaptations. Because the different implementations of the ROTATE and TRANSLATE functions between Pyplams and plasm.js, the model is not perfectly the. It could be fixed easily though:\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio pyplasm (1).png)\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio pyplasm (2).png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# The rocking chair: *Sgarsulv*\r\n![Sgarsulv image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/master/final-project/armchair%20Sgarsulv/reference%20images/armchair%20Sgarsulv.jpg)\r\n## Specifications\r\n* Infos: Gae Aulenti rocking chair \"Sgarsulv\" for Poltronova, Italy, 1962.\r\n* Composition: beechwood structure tinted with aniline, original seat in leather.\r\n* Eras: 1900s / 20th century\r\n* Styles: Italian, '60s style\r\n* Materials: beechwood, leather.\r\n* Measurements: 73,5 x 92 x 86 cm (DxWxH)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhoever loves rocking chairs should recognize Sgarsulv: it is an iconic work of Gae Aulenti designed in 1962 for Poltronova, an Italian factory famous for producing quality seats that made italian design history.\r\nSgarsulv is made of a wood curved structure enhanced by a soft padding covered in quality leather. Its elegant and timeless design can decorate with style any room.\r\n\r\n### The coffe table: Jumbo\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
