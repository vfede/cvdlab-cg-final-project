These are a table lamp, a rocking chair and a coffee table.\r\n\r\n### Table of contents\r\n* The Architect\r\n* The table lamp: Quadrifoglio\r\n* The rocking chair: Sgarsulv\r\n* The coffe table: Jumbo\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# The Architect\r\n\r\n## Gaetana Aulenti (1927 – 2012)\r\n![Gae Aulenti image](https://github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/raw/gh-pages/02_gae-aulenti_popup.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Her life\r\nBetter known as Gae Aulenti, she was an architect, designer, theorist and one of the best-known Italian designers in the second half of the 20th century. Her reputation being enhanced by a major award at the 1964 Milan Triennale, her participation in the seminal Italy: The New Domestic Landscape at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1972 and her award-winning layout of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris (1980-86).\r\nIn addition to her striking \"Arrivo al Mare\" installation in the Italian Pavilion at the 1964 Milan Triennale, utilizing Picasso-inspired silhouettes and mirrors, during the 1960s she also designed furniture for a number of clients. These included the department store La Rinascente, Zanotta, Poltranova and Knoll, expanding in the 1970's to include Martinelli Luce and Artemide, for whom she designed lights. Aulenti also taught at Venice School of Architecture from 1960–1962 and at the Milan School of Architecture from 1964-1967.\r\n\r\n### Her style\r\nAulenti was one of the few women designing in the postwar period in Italy while creating many elegant pieces that spanned across a wide variety of styles and influences, with a focus on modern, radical design. She did however always want the focus of the room to be the occupants, she believed the people make the room a room and to not overpower.\r\nShe had a modest style, Vogue has her saying \"advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# The table lamp: _Quadrifoglio_\r\n![quadrifoglio lamp image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio%20reference%20image.jpeg)\r\n## Specifications\r\n* Infos: Gae Aulenti table lamp \"Quadrifoglio\" for Guzzini, Italy, 1970.\r\n* Composition: chrome structure with caramel colored plastic shade.\r\n* Eras: 1900s / 20th century\r\n* Styles: Italian, '70s style\r\n* Materials: chromed steel, plastic.\r\n* Measurements: 48 x 48 x 52 cm (DxWxH)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nQuadrifoglio is a variation of the more famous \"Pipistrello\" table lamp of Gae Aulenti. It is composed by four slices of plastic supported by four steel tubes standing on a circular steel base.\r\n\r\n## Decomposition\r\nThe 3D reconstruction of Quadrifoglio lamp is composed by:\r\n* shade\r\n* circular base\r\n* supporting tubes\r\n* light bulb\r\n* bolts\r\n\r\nTo reproduce these shapes were used **custom functions for spheres, disks, toruses, cylinders and rotational surfaces**.\r\n\r\n### The rotational symmetry\r\nEach one of these elements was conceived to be a quarter of the complete object, to leverage the rotational symmetry of the lamp around the Z-axis. To obtain a complete lamp I should only change the \"copies\" parameter of the REPLICA function.\r\n![rotational symmetry image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%281%29.png)\r\n```\r\n//with copies = 4 this code construct the lamp\r\nrotationalGroup = STRUCT(REPLICA(copies)([ disk, topDisk, pillarAngles, pillarArm, foot, COMP([lampR])]));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The shade\r\nThe shade was the most interesting part to model. I imagined a quarter of the shade to be a deformed sphere, so I used the SPHERE function as a base and modified it to transform the output on the three axis. With a proper domain I could strip down the unnecessary parts and obtain the desired slice of the shade.\r\n![shade image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%280%29.png)\r\n```\r\n//this function is based on a SPHERE function but with different coefficients\r\nlampQuarterFunc = function (arg){\r\n\tvar a = arg[0];\r\n\tvar b = arg[1] + PI/2.0;\r\n\tvar u = SIN(a) * (COS(b) +1) * 0.9;\r\n\tvar v = (SIN(a)+0.25) * SIN(b);\r\n\tvar w = COS(a);\r\n\treturn [u,v,w];\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Renderings gallery\r\n![quadrifoglio image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%282%29.png)\r\n![quadrifoglio image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%283%29.png)\r\n![quadrifoglio image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%284%29.png)\r\n![quadrifoglio image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%285%29.png)\r\n![quadrifoglio image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/table%20lamp%20Quadrifoglio/renders/Quadrifoglio%20plasmJS%20%286%29.png)\r\n\r\n### Quadrifoglio - Pyplasm version\r\nThe same model was made Python-compatible with few code adaptations.

Its elegant and timeless design can decorate with style any room.\r\n![Sgarsulv measures image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/reference%20images/armchair%20Sgarsulv_measures.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Decomposition\r\nThe 3D reconstruction of Sgarsulvlamp is composed by two main parts:\r\n* curved wood structure\r\n* leather seat with pillows and paddings\r\n\r\n### The wood structure\r\nThe wood structure itself is made of three main compounds:\r\n* wood structure on the ground\r\n* wood structure of the seatback\r\n* wood planks refinements\r\n\r\nTo reproduce these shapes were used **Bézier curves, a custom function for surfaces between Bézier curves, cuboids**.\r\n\r\nThe supporting structure of Sgarsulv is perfect to be modeled by Bézier curves. With Bézier curves it is possible to have convoluted curves that slightly differ from one to another. To scale the curves I wrote a custom function that transform every control point of these specific curves.\r\n![Sgarsulv Bézier curves](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%281%29.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I coded a function that builds the interpolating surface between Bézier curves, to make the solid model of the wood structure. Some cuboid were applied to refine the model.\r\n![Sgarsulv wood](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%283%29.png)\r\n\r\n### The leather seat\r\nThe leather seat itself is made of four main parts:\r\n* thin leather seat with red seams\r\n* two tubular curved paddings\r\n* head pillow\r\n* cylindrical pillow\r\n\r\nTo reproduce these shapes were used **Bézier curves, a custom function for surfaces between Bézier curves, cylinders, half toruses, profile-product surfaces**.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the seat was the two symmetrical paddings. They are builded from two Bézier curves: one for the curved profile and one closed curve for the section. They are connected by the thin leather seat with the visibles red seams, modeled by other two Bézier curves not in the same plane as the paddings to reproduce the depth of the seat.\r\n```\r\n//seat tubular right padding\r\nseatPaddingProfile = BEZIER(S0)([[1, 0, 0], [0.87, 0, 0], [0.12, 0, 0.77], [0.61, 0, 1.62]]);\r\nseatPaddingSection = BEZIER(S1)([[0.51, 0.83], [0.19, 1.22], [0.19, 0.45], [0.51 , 0.83]]);\r\npaddingTube = MAP(PROFILEPROD_SURFACE([seatPaddingProfile, seatPaddingSection]))(dom2D);\r\n```\r\n![Sgarsulv seat](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%282%29.png)\r\n\r\n## Renderings gallery\r\n![Sgarsulv image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%284%29.png)\r\n![Sgarsulv image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%285%29.png)\r\n![Sgarsulv image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%286%29.png)\r\n![Sgarsulv image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/armchair%20Sgarsulv/renders/Sgarsulv%20plasmJS%20%287%29.png)\r\n\r\n### Sgarsulv - Pyplasm version\r\nThe same model was made Python-compatible with few code adaptations.

It is the ideal for residential places and for offices and lounges too. It is made entirely of marble and rest on a pair of legs for each corner. To protect the marble it is applied a transparent finishing in polyester. It is produced with various marble, such as Carrara white, Calacatta white, Marquina black and others red marbles.\r\nThe table weights 200kg.\r\n\r\n![Jumbo corner image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/coffe%20table%20Jumbo/coffe%20table%20Jumbo%20reference%20%281%29.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Decomposition\r\nThe 3D reconstruction of Jumbo is composed by three main parts:\r\n* table plan\r\n* legs\r\n* marble vains\r\n\r\nThe table plan and legs are simpy reporduced as cuboids and cylinders.\r\nThe most challenging part was the recreations of the marble vains. I used the concepts introduced in HW3 to reproduce a spiked surface. Combining this with the flat table plan, I simulated the vains of the marble.\r\n```\r\n//function to randomize the heights of a plane given a 2d domain\r\nfunction randomPattern(dom2d){\r\n    dom2d[z]=Math.floor((Math.random()*3)+1);\r\n    return dom2d;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Jumbo image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/coffe%20table%20Jumbo/renders/coffe%20table%20Jumbo%20plasmJS%20%284%29.png)\r\n\r\n## Renderings gallery\r\n![Jumbo image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/coffe%20table%20Jumbo/renders/coffe%20table%20Jumbo%20plasmJS%20%283%29.png)\r\n![Jumbo image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/coffe%20table%20Jumbo/renders/coffe%20table%20Jumbo%20plasmJS%20%281%29.png)\r\n![Jumbo image](https://raw.github.com/vfede/cvdlab-cg-final-project/master/coffe%20table%20Jumbo/renders/coffe%20table%20Jumbo%20plasmJS%20%282%29.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
