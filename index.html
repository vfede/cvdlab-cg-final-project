<a name="her-life" class="anchor" href="#her-life"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Her life</h3>

<p>Better known as Gae Aulenti, she was an architect, designer, theorist and one of the best-known Italian designers in the second half of the 20th century. Her reputation being enhanced by a major award at the 1964 Milan Triennale, her participation in the seminal Italy: The New Domestic Landscape at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1972 and her award-winning layout of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris (1980-86).
In addition to her striking "Arrivo al Mare" installation in the Italian Pavilion at the 1964 Milan Triennale, utilizing Picasso-inspired silhouettes and mirrors, during the 1960s she also designed furniture for a number of clients. These included the department store La Rinascente, Zanotta, Poltranova and Knoll, expanding in the 1970's to include Martinelli Luce and Artemide, for whom she designed lights. Aulenti also taught at Venice School of Architecture from 1960–1962 and at the Milan School of Architecture from 1964-1967.</p>

<a name="her-style" class="anchor" href="#her-style"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Her style</h3>

<p>Aulenti was one of the few women designing in the postwar period in Italy while creating many elegant pieces that spanned across a wide variety of styles and influences, with a focus on modern, radical design. She did however always want the focus of the room to be the occupants, she believed the people make the room a room and to not overpower.
She had a modest style, Vogue has her saying "advice to whoever asks me how to make a home is to not have anything, just a few shelves for books, some pillows to sit on. And then, to take a stand against the ephemeral, against passing trends...and to return to lasting values."</p>
